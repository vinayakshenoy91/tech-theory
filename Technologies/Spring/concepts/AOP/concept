- Spring uses aspect-oriented programming (AOP). AOP is another way of thinking about the structure of software. 
It enables you to modularize things like transaction management or performance logging, 
features that span multiple types and objects (cross-cutting concerns). 

Concept|Description

Aspect|The modularization of a cross-cutting concern. In general, this is a Java class with the org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect annotation.

Join Point|A point during the execution of a program. This can be the execution of a method, the assignment of a field, or the handling of an exception. In Spring, a join point is always the execution of a method!

Advice|The specific action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. There are several types of advice: before, after, after throwing, after returning, and around. In Spring, an advice is called an interceptor because we are intercepting method invocations.

Pointcut|A predicate that matches join points. The advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matching the pointcut. Spring uses the AspectJ expression language by default. Join points can be written using the org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Pointcut annotation.
