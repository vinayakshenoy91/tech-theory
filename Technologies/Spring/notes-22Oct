1) What is dependency injection?
--------------------------------
- Object declare dependencies they need and it is responsibility of framework 
to provide concerete dependencies to object

Types of injection:
- Setter injection
- Constructor injection
- interface injection

-  Coding against the interface is the underlying principle. So that we can smoothly swap
the implementation.
