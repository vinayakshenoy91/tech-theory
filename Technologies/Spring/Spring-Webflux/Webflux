- Spring Boot 2.0 is based on Spring Framework 5.0, which came with built-in support for developing reactive applications. 
Spring Framework uses Project Reactor as the base implementation of its reactive support, and also comes with a new web framework, 
Spring WebFlux, which supports the development of reactive, that is, non-blocking, HTTP clients and services.

Spring WebFlux supports two different programming models:

An annotation-based imperative style, similar to the already existing web framework, Spring Web MVC, 
but with support for reactive services
A new function-oriented model based on routers and handlers


- Spring WebFlux also provides a fully reactive HTTP client, WebClient, as a complement to the existing RestTemplate client.

- Spring WebFlux supports running on a servlet container (it requires Servlet v3.1 or higher), but also supports reactive 
non-servlet-based embedded web servers such as Netty (https://netty.io/).
