Why reactive programming?
- Thread per request model
- Thread pool size embedded in tomcat is 200
- Thread is an expensive resource and can easily take 1MB of heap space.
So less heap space for actually processing request.
- Concurrency is limited in spring mvc


Ways to handle async?
- Callback
- Completable future - Can handle multiple future.Future that returns many elements.
CompletableFuture<List<Result>> will need to wait for the whole collection to built and readily available.


Use reactive programming?
- When high load. 400TPS.
- Netty is a non-blocking server using event loop model
- Project reactor library is used to write non-blocking code.

Reactive stream spec:
- 4 interfaces: Publisher, subscriber, subscription,processor.

Project reactor: 
-----------------
- implementation of reactive stream spec.
- Reactive library
- Flux and mono is a reactive type that implements the Reactive streams spec.
- Flux and mono is a part of reactor core module.
- Flux is a reactive type to represent 0 to N elements.
- Mono is a reactivr type to represent 0 to 1 element.

Dependencies:
-------------
- reactor-core
- logback
- Reactor-test
- junit-jupiter
- mockito-junit-jupiter
- mockito-core
