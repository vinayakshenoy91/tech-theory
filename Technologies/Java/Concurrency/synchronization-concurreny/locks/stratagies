- of the java.util.concurrent.locks package

Fine grained locking vs coarse grained locking:
------------------------------------------------
- In coarse grained locking, you will have just 1 lock.
- In fined grained locking, you have multiple locks and here you will have chances of deadlock

Conditions for deadlock:
-------------------------
1) Mutual Exclusion - only one thread can have exclusive access to resource.
2) Hold and wait - At least one thread is holding a resource  and is waiting for another resource.
3) Non-preemptive allocation - A resource is released only after the thread is done using it.
4) Circular wait - A chain of atleast two threads each one is holding one resource and waiting for another resource.


- Solution to avoid deadlock is to keep the order of the lock same.
