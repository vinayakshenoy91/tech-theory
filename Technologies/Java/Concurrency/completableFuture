- Introduced in java 8
- Async operation in functional style
- Common forkjoinpool is used in completable future.Also have options to use a User-defined ThreadPool
- CompletableFuture is an Async Reactive Functional Programming api
- Reactive api has: 
 1) Resilient - Exception or error will not crash app or code
 2) Responsive
 3) Message driven - Async computation interact with each through message in a event-driven style.
 4) Elastic - Async computation normally run in a pool of threads. Number of threads can go up or down based on need.

- Extends Future and CompletionStage[Chain async computation]

- CompletableFuture apis can be grouped into two:

1) Factory methods: Intiiate async computation
2) Completion stage methods: Chain async computation
3) Exception methods: Handle exceptions in async computation
