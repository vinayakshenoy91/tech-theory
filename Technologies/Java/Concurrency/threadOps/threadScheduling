preemptive scheduling and time slicing
Under preemptive scheduling, the highest priority task executes until it enters the waiting or dead states or a 
higher priority task comes into existence. Under time slicing, a task executes for a predefined slice of time and 
then reenters the pool of ready tasks. 
The scheduler then determines which task should execute next, based on priority and other factors.
