Latency: Time to completion of a task.

Throughput: Amount of tasks completed ina given period.Measured in tasks/time unit.

#thread = #core is optimal only if all threads are runnable and can run withut interruption
(no IO/blocking calls/sleep)
- assumption is nothing else runs that conumes lot of CPU
