- Field shadowing : A parameter can have same name as the field of a class.[Usually seen being used in constructors]


- Arbitrary number of args:

public void printRoute(String... points){
    for(String  point: points){
        System.out.println(point);
    }
}


Why is this used?
- this is used to access instance field/ avoid shadowing. this.x = x;
- Explicit constructor call.Call one constructor from another. this(x).
