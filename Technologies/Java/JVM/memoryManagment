Tools to analyse Heap space/Memory leak:
-----------------------------------------
Tool to analyse heap size is Visual VM.

Stack:
-----
- Every thread will have stack.
- Great for local variables.
- Save simple datatype like primitives.
One exception: If the Object types are not shared and are removed at end of block of code, then they are stored in stack
rather than heap.

Heap:
-----
- Common memory accessed by multiple threads.
- String, Customer, Integer objects
- However, variable reference on object is stored on stack.


Metaspace:
-----------
- General metadata of classes , methods etc
- Static primitives stored in Metaspace
- Static variables are stored in Heap with pointer in Metaspace.
- Objects referenced from metaspace in a heap will never be garbage collected.

Note; put string in pool explicitly => i.toString().intern()


String pool:
-------------
- Hashcode of string is calculated to check where does the string sit in the pool
- Starts with 16 bucket.
