Memory managment:
----------------
- Each core had L1 and L2 cache and then a comming L3 cache shared by all cores. These all lie in CPU.
CPU comm to main memory via bus
- Main memory is in GBs
  Size of L2 cache: 256kB
  Size of L1 cache: 32kB

Visibility: - Guarantees consistency of variable.
-----------
Value of the item on main memroy has been modified and the correct value is in one of the caches  of CPU and 
should not be fetched from main memory
- All the sync write are visible.
- Visibility means a read should return the value set by the last write.

- Happens-before link exists between all sync or volatile write ops
and all sync or volatile read ops that follow.

False sharing:
--------------
- Cache is organised in lines of data
- Each line can hold 8 longs (64 bytes)
- When a visible variable is modified in an L1 cache, all the line is marked "dirty" for the other caches.
- A read on a dirty line triggers a refresh on this line.
- Use padding to avoid this issue.
