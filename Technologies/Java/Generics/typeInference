- It is the ability of compiler to look at each method invocation and corresponding declaration
in order to determine the type argument  such as T generic type that make invocation applicable.

- The type inference algo determines the <T> type of arguments.
and the type that the result is being assigned or returned if available.

<T> is to tell java that we are using generic type

- Type inference algo tries to find the most specific type that works with all of the arguments.
