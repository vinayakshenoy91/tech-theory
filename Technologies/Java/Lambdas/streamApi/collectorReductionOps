Some of the important reduction operations already implemented in the Collectors class are listed below:

Method	Purpose
toList()	Collects stream elements in a List.
toSet()	Collects stream elements in a Set.
toMap()	Returns a Collector that accumulates elements into a Map whose keys and values are the result of applying the provided 
        mapping functions to the input elements.
collectingAndThen()	Collects stream elements and then transforms them using a Function
summingDouble(), summingLong(), summingInt()	Sums-up stream elements after mapping them to a Double/Long/Integer value 
                                                using specific type Function
reducing()	Reduces elements of stream based on the BinaryOperator function provided
partitioningBy()	Partitions stream elements into a Map based on the Predicate provided
counting()	Counts the number of stream elements
groupingBy()	Produces Map of elements grouped by grouping criteria provided
mapping()	Applyies a mapping operation to all stream elements being collected
joining()	For concatenation of stream elements into a single String
minBy()/maxBy()	Finds the minimum/maximum of all stream elements based on the Comparator provided
