String:
------
- Once string is created, its value cannot be changed.

String x = "Hello"; //This will look 
String x = new String("Hello");

- When in loop, do not use simple string. Use string builder or string buffer.
Or any value modification in string.

String buffer:
--------------
StringBuffer s3 = new StringBuffer("Value1");

String s2="Value2";

for(int i=0;i<10000;++i){
    s3.append(s2);
}


Note: Both string and string buffer are thread safe. String buffer is implemnted using 
synchronized keyword on all methods.

String builder:
---------------
- Not thread safe and performs better if thread safety is not a priority.
