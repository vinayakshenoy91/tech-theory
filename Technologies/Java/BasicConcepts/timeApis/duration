- Duration represents the time-based amount of time in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as 8 minutes. 
- This class is used to modify a given time or to find the difference between times.

a) Creating a duration:
-------------------------
Duration duration = Duration.ofDays(1);  // Created a duration of 1 day.
System.out.println(duration.getSeconds() + " seconds"); // This will return the number of seconds in a day.

duration = Duration.ofHours(2);  // Created a duration of 2 hours.
System.out.println(duration.getSeconds() + " seconds"); // This will return the number of seconds in 2 hours.

duration = Duration.ofMinutes(23);  // Created a duration of 23 minutes.
System.out.println(duration.getSeconds() + " seconds"); // This will return the number of seconds in 23 minutes.
        
duration = Duration.of(1, ChronoUnit.HOURS);
System.out.println(duration.getSeconds() + " seconds");

b) Finding the difference between two values of values:
--------------------------------------------------------
Duration duration = Duration.between(LocalTime.parse("12:14"), LocalTime.parse("13:15"));
System.out.println("The difference is " + duration.getSeconds() + " Seconds");
