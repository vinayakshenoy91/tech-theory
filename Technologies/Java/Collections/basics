Collection vs Collections??

- Collection is an interface whereas Collections is a utility class in java.
- A Collection interface provides the standard functionality of a data structure to List, Set, and Queue. However, 
the Collections class provides the utility methods that can be used to search, sort, and synchronize collection elements.


- All collection can be derived from java.util.Collection interface.
- toArray() can transform any Collectioninto a 1D array
- The collection interface extends the java.lang.iterable interface and that is why we can use for-each loop.



Misc methods:
-------------
List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>():

Collections.reverse(nums); //Reverses order of insertion

Collections.min(x);
Collections.max(x);

Collections.shuffle(nums);

Collections.rotate(nums,1);

Collections.replaceAll(nums, 1,10);

Collections.unmodifiableList(nums); //Map and set versions are also presentx`
