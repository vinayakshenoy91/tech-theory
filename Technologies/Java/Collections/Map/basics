- Associative arrays (Maps or dict) are abstract data types
- Do not support sorting as they are unordered


Hashtables
----------
- Effecient storing of key and value pairs so that
- Hash function defines the relationship between keys and array indexes.
- In hash function,use modulo for integers and ascci value for strings.
- Collision occurs when the h(x) has function maps two keys to the same array slot 

1) Chaining -> Hash function puts all items in same bucket.
2) Open addressing
- Linear and quadratic probing: We try k , k+1 untilwe find an empty bucket.
- Linear not best as there will be clusters in the underlying array
&  Better cache performance than other approaches.

- Quadratic probing will not have clusters and no cache advantage.
3) Rehashing

- Load factor -> actual items/total buckets
load factor > 0.75 -> java resize the hash table.
For python, load factor is 0.66

-> problem is that hash values are depending on the size  of underlying array DS.
So all items in old hash table has to be inserted into the new one with the hash function.

-> it takes O(N) linear running time - So dynamic sized has table inappropriate for real time apps.
