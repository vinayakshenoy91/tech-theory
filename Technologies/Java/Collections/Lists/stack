- Stack is an ADT and can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- push, pop and peek
- LIFO

cons:
----
- Stacks implement Vectors an Stack are inherently synchronized.
Sync is not always required and an use ArrayDeque.



apps:
------
- DFS implemented using stacks
- finding Eulerian cycles in a G(V,E) graph.
- find strongly connected components in a graph
