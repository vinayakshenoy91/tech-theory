- Eclipse Vert.x is an event-driven toolkit for building reactive applications on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Vert.x does not impose a specific framework or packaging model; it can be used within your existing applications and 
frameworks in order to add reactive functionality by just adding the Vert.x jar files to the application classpath.

Eclipse Vert.x enables building reactive systems as defined by The Reactive Manifesto and builds services that are:

Responsive: to handle requests in a reasonable time

Resilient: to stay responsive in the face of failures

Elastic: to stay responsive under various loads and be able to scale up and down

Message-driven: components interact using asynchronous message passing

The unit of deployment in Vert.x is called a verticle. A verticle processes incoming events over an event loop, 
where events can be anything such as 
receiving network buffers, timing events, or messages sent by other verticles.

Commands:
---------
mvn compile vertx:run -> start gateway
