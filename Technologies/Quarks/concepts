Quarkus is a full stack, Kubernetes-native Java framework made for Java virtual machines (JVMs) and native compilation, 
optimizing Java specifically for containers and 
enabling it to become an effective platform for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments.

It also provides the correct information to GraalVM (a universal virtual machine for running apps written in several 
languages, 
including Java and JavaScript) for a native compilation of your application.

By extending PanacheEntity, we’re using the active record persistence pattern instead of a Data Access Obect (DAO). 
This means that all persistence methods are blended with our own Entity

- only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. 
You can configure this using the different Scoped annotations (ApplicationScoped, RequestScoped, etc).
