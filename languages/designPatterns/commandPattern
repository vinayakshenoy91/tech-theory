The Command Pattern allows you to decouple the requester of an action from the object that actually performs the action. 
So, here the requester would be the remote control and the object 
that performs the action would be an instance of one of your vendor classes.

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize 
other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

- Commands give us a way to package a piece of computation (a receiver and a set of actions) and 
pass it around as a first-class object.



//Core point of decoupling
public interface Command{
    public void execute();
}

//Implementing the command
public class LighOnCommand implements Command{
    Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light){
        this.light=light;
    }

    public void execute(){
        light.on();
    }
}

//Attachign object to remote
public class SimpleRemoteControl{
    Command slot;
    public SimpleRemoteControl(){};

    public void setCommand(Command command){
        slot = command;
    }

    public void buttonWasPressed(){
        slot.execute();
    }
}


//No command pattern
public class NoCommand implements Command {
    public void execute() { }
}


//Using lambdas for remote loader

public class RemoteLoader{

   public static void main(String[] args){

       RemoteControl control = new RemoteControl();

       Light livingRoomLight = new Light("Living room");

       control.setCommand(0,()-> livingRoomLight.on(), livingRoomLight.off())

   }

}




More uses of the Command Pattern: logging requests
The semantics of some applications require that we log all actions and be able to recover after a crash by reinvoking those actions. The Command Pattern can support these semantics with the addition of two methods: store() and load(). In Java we could use object serialization to implement these methods, but the normal caveats for using serialization for persistence apply.

How does this work? As we execute commands, we store a history of them on disk. When a crash occurs, we reload the command objects and invoke their execute() methods in batch and in order.

Now, this kind of logging wouldn’t make sense for a remote control; however, there are many applications that invoke actions on large data structures that can’t be quickly saved each time a change is made. By using logging, we can save all the operations since the last checkpoint, and if there is a system failure, apply those operations to our checkpoint. Take, for example, a spreadsheet application: we might want to implement our failure recovery by logging the actions on the spreadsheet rather than writing a copy of the spreadsheet to disk every time a change occurs. In more advanced applications, these techniques can be extended to apply to sets of operations in a transactional manner so that all of the operations complete, or none of them do.

Each command will do a execute, store and load.
