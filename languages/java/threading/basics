Thread:
-------
- Set of instruction
- It is a light weight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing.
- It is required for responsiveness and perf.
- The files, data(heap), code are shared. Stack and instruction pointer are specific to each thread.
Stack -> Region in memeory where local variables are stored and passed to functions.
Instruction pointer -> address of the next instruction to execute.
- Thread is at OS level and JVM leverages the service given by OS

Attributes of a thread:
-----------------------
ID: This attribute stores a unique identifier for each thread.
Name: This attribute stores the name of the thread.
If you don't specify a name for a thread, JVM automatically assigns it one in this format: Thread-XX, where XX is a number. 
Priority: This attribute stores the priority of the Thread objects. In Java 9, threads can have priority between
1 and 10, where 1 is the lowest priority and 10 is the highest. It's not recommended that you change the 
priority of the threads. It's only a hint to the underlying 
operating system and it doesn't guarantee anything, but it's a possibility that you can use if you want.
Status: This attribute stores the status of a thread. In Java, a thread can be present in one of the six 
states defined in the Thread.State enumeration: NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, or TERMINATED. 

Thread state:
-------------
New
Runnable -> When start method called.
Terminated

Blocked -> waiting at entrace of sync block.
Waiting -> parked using a wait call.
Time_waiting -> slee(timeout) or wait(timeout)

Thread t = ..
Thread.State state = t.getState(); //Gives an enum

NEW: The thread has been created and it has not yet started
RUNNABLE: The thread is being executed in the JVM
BLOCKED: The thread is blocked and it is waiting for a monitor
WAITING: The thread is waiting for another thread
TIMED_WAITING: The thread is waiting for another thread with a specified waiting time
TERMINATED: The thread has finished its execution


Features of multithreading:
---------------------------
- multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area
- and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.
- Too many threads leads to Thrashing where processor spend more time in management than rela productive work.
- Thread consume less resource than process. Context switch between threads in same process is cheaper than threads between process.

Thread scheduling operation:
----------------------------
- OS divides times into epochs and schedules part of each thread in them.
- Dynamic priority = static priority + bonus[Can be negative].
bonus is adjusted by OS in every epoch for each thread.
- OS give pref to intractive threads.It also gives preference to threads that did not complete
int he last epochs or did not get enough time to run to prevent starvation.

prefer multithread:
- create and destroy thred faster
- data is shared.
- short context switches.

Prefer multiprocess:
- security and stability of higher importance.
- Task are unrelated.


Multitasking:
--------------
Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. 
We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:

1) Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing):
--------------------------------------------------
Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
A process is heavyweight.
Cost of communication between the process is high.
Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps, updating lists, etc.

2) Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading):
-----------------------------------------------
Threads share the same address space.
A thread is lightweight.

- A process can be made of multiple threads. OS can have multiple process.
Only one thread can run in a process.




Java thread methods:
---------------------
void	start()	It is used to start the execution of the thread.
2)	void	run()	It is used to do an action for a thread.
3)	static void	sleep()	It sleeps a thread for the specified amount of time.
4)	static Thread	currentThread()	It returns a reference to the currently executing thread object.
5)	void	join()	It waits for a thread to die.
6)	int	getPriority()	It returns the priority of the thread.
7)	void	setPriority()	It changes the priority of the thread.
8)	String	getName()	It returns the name of the thread.
9)	void	setName()	It changes the name of the thread.
10)	long	getId()	It returns the id of the thread.
11)	boolean	isAlive()	It tests if the thread is alive.
12)	static void	yield()	It causes the currently executing thread object to pause and allow other threads to execute temporarily.
13)	void	suspend()	It is used to suspend the thread.
14)	void	resume()	It is used to resume the suspended thread.
15)	void	stop()	It is used to stop the thread.
16)	void	destroy()	It is used to destroy the thread group and all of its subgroups.
17)	boolean	isDaemon()	It tests if the thread is a daemon thread.
18)	void	setDaemon()	It marks the thread as daemon or user thread.
19)	void	interrupt()	It interrupts the thread.
20)	boolean	isinterrupted()	It tests whether the thread has been interrupted.
21)	static boolean	interrupted()	It tests whether the current thread has been interrupted.
22)	static int	activeCount()	It returns the number of active threads in the current thread's thread group.
23)	void	checkAccess()	It determines if the currently running thread has permission to modify the thread.
24)	static boolean	holdLock()	It returns true if and only if the current thread holds the monitor lock on the specified object.
25)	static void	dumpStack()	It is used to print a stack trace of the current thread to the standard error stream.
26)	StackTraceElement[]	getStackTrace()	It returns an array of stack trace elements representing the stack dump of the thread.
27)	static int	enumerate()	It is used to copy every active thread's thread group and its subgroup into the specified array.
28)	Thread.State	getState()	It is used to return the state of the thread.
29)	ThreadGroup	getThreadGroup()	It is used to return the thread group to which this thread belongs
30)	String	toString()	It is used to return a string representation of this thread, including the thread's name, priority, and thread group.
31)	void	notify()	It is used to give the notification for only one thread which is waiting for a particular object.
32)	void	notifyAll()	It is used to give the notification to all waiting threads of a particular object.
33)	void	setContextClassLoader()	It sets the context ClassLoader for the Thread.
34)	ClassLoader	getContextClassLoader()	It returns the context ClassLoader for the thread.
35)	static Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler	getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler()	It returns the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception.
36)	static void	setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler()	It sets the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception.


Race conditon:
---------------
Two diff threads are trying to read and write the same variable at the same time.


Note:
------
- Join immediately releases the key
