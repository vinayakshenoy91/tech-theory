- Items are retrived in random order in which they are added.
- Will allow for nukll key and null values

Working?
----------
- Built on an array
- Compute hashcode from key -> whihc cell to put the key in
- Each cell is called a bucket.Check if bucket is there or not.Check if key is there or not if bucket exists
- In hashmap, it will create a linked list  upto a certain number of key value pair and will switch 
to Red-black tree post this number.
- Update map
hash % bucket_count

- Above step must not be interrupted by any thread in concurrent world

- Hashmap has a factor of 0.75 and will double its size when it reaches this.
Resizing requires every item to be re-evaluated as the hash changes.

Map<String, Book> books = new HashMap<String,Book>(500000, 0.6f);

Hashcode rules:
---------------
- You should get good range of numbers
- Equal objects must have equal hash codes.

- Use key as hashcode to get effeciency
