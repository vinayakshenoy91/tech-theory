- NoSQL and can go upto 1M requests/sec
- Architecture similar to cassandra
- No disk space t provision
- It is a partitioned B-tree structure.
- It is immediately consistent and hihgly durable.
- Single attribute partition key and optional single attribute sort key.
- Max item size if 400kb
- Composite primary key [like year and title] -> Primary key and sort key
- Partition key must be chosen such that it has large number of unique values.

- DynamoDB Global Table -> Multi-region, Multi-master
- Supports ACID
- Backup with point in time recovery
- Supports TTL
- Capacity : provisioned(WCU, RCU, Autoscaling) or on-demand
- Eventual or strong consistency can be set
- Supports txn across multipel tables
- Backups and point in time recovery
- IAM for security
- Storage can corss hundreds of TBs

Basics:
--------
- It is made of tables
- Each table has a primary key (decided at creation time)
- each table can have infinite num of rows
- Types supported are:
  a) Scalar Types: String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
  b) Document Types:   List, Map
  c) Set Types: String Set, Number Set, Binary Set 

Primary keys:
--------------
1) Parition key only (HASH)
2) Partition key + sort key(timestamp) -> Data grouped by partition key and sort key == range key (User_id for parition key and game_id for sort key)


Trade-off while choosing:
------------------------
- You need to pull the data and do the processing at app end. (Ex: Finding value of all orders for a customer)
- Storing 1TB data is 10 times as that stored in S3
- Cost optimization: On-demand costs $1.25 per million writes, and $0.25 per million reads
- Provisioned capacity: On paper, that same workload that cost $1/day to serve 1 million pages would only cost $0.14/day 
with provisioned capacity, which seems like a very spectacular cost reduction. However, this calculation assumes that:

1)Requests are evenly distributed over the course of the day
2)There is absolutely zero capacity headroom. (You would get throttled if there were a million and one requests in a day.)
Obviously, both of these assumptions are impractical. In reality, you’re going to have to provide abundant headroom in order to deal 
with the peak request rate,as well as to handle any general uncertainty in demand. With provisioned capacity, 
you will have the burden to monitor your utilization and proactively provision the necessary capacity.

- move from on-demand to provisioned

DynamoDb indexes:
--------------------
1) LSI - Local secondary Index:
--------------------------------
- Keep same primary key 
- select alternative sort key
- Defined at table creation time

2) Global secondary Index:
---------------------------
- Change priamnry key and optional sort key 
- Can be defined after table is created

- Overall, you can only query by pk + sort key ont he main table and indexes


1) Local index:

The only advantage of local indexes is that they’re immediately consistent, but they do come with a very insidious downside. 
Once you create a local index on a table, the property that allows a table to keep growing indefinitely goes away. Local indexes come with the 
constraint that all the records that share the same partition key need to fit in 10 GB, 
and once that allocation gets exhausted, all write operations with that partition key will start failing.

2)Global index:global indexes don’t constrain your table size in any way, but reading from them is eventually consistent 
(although the delay is almost always unnoticeable). 

DynamoDB has an internal queue-like system between the main table and the global index, and this queue has a fixed (but opaque) size. 
Therefore, if the provisioned throughput of a global index happens to be insufficient to keep up with updates on the main table, then 
that queue can get full. When that happens, disaster strikes: All write operations on the main table start failing.

The most problematic part of this behavior is that there’s no way to monitor the state of this internal queue. So, the only way to prevent it is:

To monitor the throttled request count on all your global indexes, and then to react quickly to any throttling by provisioning 
additional capacity on the affected indexes.




Features:
---------
1) TTL 
2) DynamoDB streams : 
    - react to change to DynamoDB tables.
    - 24hr data retention
    - Can bwe read by lambda or EC2
3) Global tables: (Cross region replication): 
- Active active replication, many regions
- Used for low latency DR purpose
- Must enable DynamoDB streams


DynamoDB-DAX:
---------------
- DAX = DynamoDB accelerator
- Writes go through DAX to DynamoDB
- Seamless cache for dynamo DB, no app rewrite
- Microsecond latency for cached reads and queries
- 5 min TTL for cache by default
- Upto 10 nodes in cluster
- Multi AZ
- secure
