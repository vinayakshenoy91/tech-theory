Amazon SQS:
----------
- SQS is a highly-durable queue in the cloud
- duplicate messages can emerge within SQS, so your consumers should be prepared to handle this situation

# If you really need strict ordering and exactly-once delivery (no duplicates):
- SQS has an option to enable this property by marking your queue as FIFO.
- But these FIFO queues come with a throughput limit of 300 messages per second, 
so they’re only viable if you’re certain that your message rate will remain well clear of that limit.

Standard queue:
---------------
- Unlimited throughput, unlimited message in queue
- Message will stay in queue for 4 days or 14 days
- low latency <10ms on publish and receive
- < 256KBs per message sent
- Atleast once delivery
- Can have out of order messages
- Consumer polls SQS for messages.Consumer consumes and deletes it.
- Metrics for horizonal scaling is Approx queue length -> Approximate NumberOfMessages
- if message not read in 30s it will go back  into queue.

Visibility timeout -> based on you consumer processing time.
- Once message is polled by consumer, it becomes invisible to other customers.
- A consumer could call the ChangeMessageVisibility API to get more time.
- If visibility timeout low-> multiple messages

DLQ:
----
- After a max number of visibility timeout for a message = Maximum Receives, the message can be pushed to a DLQ
- use 14 days retention

Delay queue:
-----------
- Delay a message upto 15 min so that consumers dont see it.consumer sees it onky after 15 min
- DelaySeconds at queue level. 
- Individual message delay  capability

FIFO:
-----
- Ordering of message and exactly once delivery.
- limited throughput 300msgs/s without batching, 3000msgs/s with batching
- Queue name should end with <queuename>.fifo
- You can have a group id

Encryption:
- In flight encryption using https api
- At rest encryption using KMS keys
- Client side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption/decryptionitself.
- SQS access policies similar to S3 bucket policies.
    - Useful for cross account access to SQS queue.
    - Useful for other service to write to SQS queue.
- Access controls: IAM policies to regulate access to SQS API
