- CDN
- Global edge network
- Improve read perf, content cached at the edge (216 POP)
- CloudFront Geo restriction. Usecase: Copyright laws to control access to content.
only allow to access content from  a particular region
- Files are cached for a TTL 

Features:
- DDoS protection
- Integration with sheild
- AWS web app firewall
- Expose external HTTPS and can talk to internal HTTPS backend as well

Cloud Front origins:
--------------------
1) If origin is S3 then:
- Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity(OAI). OAI is allowed to talk to S3 bucket using s3 bucket policy.
Once this is in place no one can access the bucket except cloudfront. If content now in edge, requested from s3 using private aws network

- CloudFront as Ingress to upload file to S3

2) S3 website:
- Must first establish the bcket as stastic s3 website

3) If origin is custom origin(HTTP) can be:
- EC2
- ALB
- Api gateway
- Any http backend

Whitelist ip address of cloudfront in Ec2 security group 
Have primary and secondary origin 

Cloudfront Signed URL / Signed cookies:
-----------------------------------------
-  Want to distribute paid content to premium users all over the world, we can use CloudFront Signed URL/Cookie.

We attach a policy with :
- URL expiration
- IP ranges to access data from
- Trusted signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URL)

Signed URL -> Acces to individual files (one signed url per file)

Signed cookies -> access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)

Cloudfront signed vs S3 pre-signed url:
---------------------------------------
Cloudfront signed url:
- CloudFront signed url is allow access to path no matter the origin
- Account wide key-pair, only root can manage it
- Can filter by ip, path data, expiration
- Can leverage caching features

S3 pre-signed url:
- Issue a request as the person who presigned the url
- Ltd lifetime
- Uses IAM key of the signing IAM principal

Cloudfront geo restriction:
----------------------------
- Who can access your distribution; Whitelist or blacklist
- Country os determined using 3rd party geo ip DB
Usecase: Copyright laws to control access to content

Cloudfront caching:
--------------------
Cache based on:
- Headers
- Session cookies
- Query string param 

Cache lives at each cloudfront edge location

- TTL using Cach-Control hewader, Expires Header


Lambda@Edge:
-----------
- Deploy a lambda alongside cloudfront CDN
- Build more responsive apps
- Customise CDN content
- place this lambda before or after cloudfront
