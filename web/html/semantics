Semantic markup is a method of writing and formatting the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to emphasize the semantic meaning, or purpose 
of the content, as opposed to its appearance.

- Semantics and accessibility are part of HTML 

“Semantic markup-ing” means understanding the hierarchy of your web page’s content and how it will be read by both users and machines. 
Much of that may sound like good judgment; when you write a heading, 
mark it with a heading tag (<h1>, <h2>, etc.), and when you write a paragraph you write a paragraph, mark it with a paragraph tag (<p>)

- Semantic markup means that HTML tags are never selected based on how they appear in a web browser-they are selected based 
on the content 's importance and structure.

While HTML has included semantic markup from the beginning, the advent of HTML5 brought with it even more semantic tags such as <section>, 
<article>, <footer>, <nav>, and <aside>.

The aim of using semantic markup is to make it simpler for browsers, programmers, and crawlers to differentiate between specific data types. 
All these semantic tags make it clearer 
what information is on the web page and how important that information is.
