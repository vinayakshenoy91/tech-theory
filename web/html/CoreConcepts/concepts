- html has a start and end tag
- Tags are way to markup the document that is friendly to user agents
Markup describes the document.Doing this you are adding meaning to document.
- Attributes -> Other related pieces of information
- Element -> tags + attributes + contents
- Specification -> A standard of precise requirements.
- DOCTYPE - required for legacy reason. When omitted, browsers tend to use a diff rendering mode incompatible with some spec.
<!DOCTYPE html>
- <html lang="en"> -> html element is root of an HTML document. Giving lang attribute on root element gives the document's language.
This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronounciations to use, translation tools to determine what rules to use and so forth.
- metadata -> set of info that provides info about other data.
head element represents collection of metadata.
character set -> set of supported characters. UTF-8 covers almost everything in every language.
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>hello</title>
  <body>
  <section>
  <header></header> -> contains ection heading
  <footer></footer>
    <article>
    <aside></aside> //Tangential content
    </article>
  </section>
  </body>
</head>

- <article> -> Complete in itself
- Note: looks at content and make a call on which tag to use.
- Section -> does not make meaning on its own
- Hypertext -> Text that references other text which the user agent enables the user to immediately access.
- Protocol -> System of rules for two entities to communicate.
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol -> set of rules for how two entities can transfer text between themselves.
