SEO #
Understanding and using semantic markup helps ensure that we hit our target market with relevant content. Search engines assess the value 
of keywords by 
placing them in the HTML hierarchy. For example, keywords enclosed in an <h1> tag are given more importance than those enclosed in a <p> tag.

Through putting the most important keywords higher in the list, we are telling search engines what our website is about and why people 
interested in those particular keywords should be looking at our content.
