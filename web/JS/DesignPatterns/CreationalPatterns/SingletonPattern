- Constructor call is expensive and we need to happen it only once.
Like DB repo, object factory etc
- We provide everyone with same instance.
- Want to prevent anyone from creating additional copies.
- A component that is instantiated only once.

class Singleton{
    constructor(){
        const instance = this.constructor.instance;
        if(instance){
            return instance;
        }
        this.constructor.instance=this;
    }
}
