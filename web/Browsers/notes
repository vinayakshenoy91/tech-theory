Three modes defined by layout engines in web browsers:

Quirks mode:
------------
- Strategy used by some web browsers to preserve backward compatibility  with web pages built for old browsers
rather than solely complying with standard W3C  and IETF requirements in standard mode.

- Almost standards -> Rendering matches full standard mode.Sliced image-in-table layouts are less likely 
to collapse in browsers.

- Full standards mode -> Behaviour described is the same as decribed by HTML and CSS spec.
Most browsers are full standard mode.

Note: Anything before the DOCTYPE like a comment or an XML declaration will trigger quirks mode in IE9 and later.
