- This is used for functions
- This caches a function.Also cache(react's internal storage) an object
- They will be referred from same place in the memory

- For handler, use a function: 

//Basically in the handler of a component created out of map. It will re-render everything if callback not used.
 //It will bacially execute everyones handler. Along with callback, use React.memo on the component what is inside the map.

Usage:
------

1)
 useCallback(()=>{

 },[]) //Empty array is used as all are closures. Any value required for closure should be passed via this.
- When value in the array changes. We recreate that function and store it.


2) const speakerDetail = React.memo(({})=>{}) //Returns cached version

- Use react memo with useCallback as well
