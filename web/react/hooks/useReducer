- Reducer is a function that takes actiona nd previous state as parameter and returns new state.

Usecases:
- Use this if there is a uniform state change or state changing in a certain way or multiple ways

Why not useState and store object?
- Tricky to update one property
- Need to send state as an argument,ame sure other property is not cloberred.

[state,dispatch]=React.useReducer(reducer,initialState);

- dispatch function updates state. dispatch(action) -> reducer(state,action).
dispatch will pass state automatically to reducer.
- action is object with type and payload. Switch on type and use payload to update state.



1) Create a reducer
function reducer(state, action){
    const {type, payload} = action;

    switch(action.type){
        case: "secretWord":return {..., secretWord:action.payload}
        default: 
            throw new Error('invalid action type')
    }
}


2) Use that reducer
const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, {secretWord:null})

3) Send a dispatch function
const setSecretWord = (secretWord)=> dispatch({type:"setSecretWord",payload:secretWord})

Object.assign({},state,{s:'x'})
