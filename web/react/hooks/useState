- Attach localstate to react components
- Pass the set state as param to function that calls the axios call as a callback

import React, {useState} from 'react';
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);
onClick={()=>setCount(count+1)}

const [showParagraph, setShowParagraph] = useState(false);

const toggleParagraphHandler = ()=>{
    setShowParagraph((prevShowParagraph)=> !prevShowParagraph);
}
