- it is about memoizing values
- This is similar to useCallback but can be used for any kind of data
- Basically if there are filtering and soring and you dont want to to run  it again and again


If you want to cache an array, because array is created every time if you pass it as props.

useMemo(()=>[1,2,3],[]);

useMemo(()=>{
    return props.items.sort((a,b)=>a-b)
},[item1,item2]) //Item item1 and 2 are changed, the function is run again

- Compnent inside .map can be memoised as it will return same output for a given input.
