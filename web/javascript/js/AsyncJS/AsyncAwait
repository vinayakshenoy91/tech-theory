- Introduced in ES2017
- Code will look sync but will have async functionality
- await only used inside async fn. It waits for a promise.It causes async to pause.


Usage:
------

//Function declartion - hoisted to top
async function xyz(){


}

OR

//Function expression - not hoisted( JS knows that it exists but ot doesn;t know that it is a function.)
var x = async function (){


}


For promise, you use "for of" or forEach over array

Iterate through promises: with async await
------------------------
let promises = movieObj.planets.map(url=> $.getJSON(url));

for await(let pl of promises){
    console.log(pl.name);
}
