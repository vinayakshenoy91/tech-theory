- Pure functions are functions that take inputs and return the output value by meeting below 4 criteria:

a) without affecting any variable outside of their scope. 

b) These functions must return a value.

c) The return value must depend on the input arguments passed 

d) Should not have any side effect.
It seems as if the function does not have any side effects on an external state when it is executed. However, 
the console.log statement does have a side effect which violates the rule that the result should not cause any 
semantically observable side effect or output, such as mutation of mutable objects or output to I/O devices.

ex: Below one is not a pure function:
const addAndPrint = (a, b) => { 
  const sum = a+b;
  console.log(`The sum is ${sum}`)
  return sum;
};


Below one is not a pure function: //Here you are modifying an objet outside your scope.
-----------------------------------
const func = (key, value, object) => {
  object[key] = value
};

function test(){
    const car = {
    name: 'Toyota'
  };

  const answer = func('model', 88, car);
  console.log({car,answer});
}
test()
