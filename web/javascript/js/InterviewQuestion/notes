Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY
Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY

- Any value which cannot fit in 64 bit format will return infinity

- 9e4 -> Exponent presentation

- Number.MAX_VALUE
- -Number.MAX_VALUE

JS inbuilt functions:
-------------------

isNaN(0) -> Check if value is Not a Number or Not.

isFinite() -> Checks whether value is regular number or not
Checks for NaN and infinity values

Arrow function:
---------------
- "this" does not work with arrow function. Point to window object. If normal function, then it would refer the current context.
- "arguments" object does not work with arrow function
- You cannot use new to call arrow function

Closures:
---------
- Function comes under another function
- Pattern remembers outer variable and also helps to access outer scope members.
- Useful when you want to make few private members available globally when needed.
- Advantage of closure is that any member which is private for certain scope , can be accessed keeping it private so that 
the variable is away from any accidental change of value.


Currying:
---------
- Its a way to call inner functions where you can pass arguments
partially or pass multiple argumentsin a function but 1 argument at a time.


Iterables and Iterators:
------------------------

for(let i of x) //String, map ,set arrays, generators are iterable.

Error handling:
---------------
err.name
err.message
err.stack

throw new Error("Invalid age"); //TypeError

try{

}catch(){

}finally{

}


Generators:
-----------
- Helps to pause and resume the code.
- When yield found stop the executor.
const genFunction = function* (){

}

- const gObj=genFunction();
gObj.next();

[...genFunction()] -> getting all value from generator function

Memory and GC:
---------------

1) Mark and sweep:
------------------
Algo starts from root object and checks for the refernce linked.
Find unreachable locations? -> remove it
