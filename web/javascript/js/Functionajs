Programming manipulating the basis of JavaScript’s execution model
- Prototype-based object-oriented programming
Programming based around prototypical objects and instances of them
Imperative programming
Programming based around describing actions in detail

- Functional programming is about pulling programs apart 
and reassembling them from the same parts, abstracted behind function boundaries
