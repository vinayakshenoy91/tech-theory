Definition:

a closure is a function that can access the variables from another functionâ€™s scope. 
This is possible by creating nested functions. The enclosing/outer function will, however, not have access to the inner scope.

Closure usecase:

- For Object Data Privacy
- In Event Handlers
- In Callback Functions
- Currying
