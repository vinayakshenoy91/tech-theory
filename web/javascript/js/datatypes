boolean

This type can have true and false values.

symbol

This type is used to represent unique constant values, such as keys in collections.

null

This type can be assigned only the value null and is used to indicate a nonexistent or invalid reference.

undefined

This type is used when a variable has been defined but has not been assigned a value.

object

The toFixed method formats number values so they have a fixed number of digits after the decimal point:

return (amount * 1.2).toFixed(2);
