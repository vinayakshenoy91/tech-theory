SEO #
Understanding and using semantic markup helps ensure that we hit our target market with relevant content. Search engines assess the value of keywords by placing them in the HTML hierarchy. For example, keywords enclosed in an <h1> tag are given more importance than those enclosed in a <p> tag.

Through putting the most important keywords higher in the list, we are telling search engines what our website is about and why people interested in those particular keywords should be looking at our content.


Accessibility #
Since semantic HTML uses elements for a defined intent, reading and interpreting it becomes better for both humans and computers.

Making applications accessible provides equal access for people with disabilities while also helping people without disabilities 
by empowering them to customize and tailor their experiences.

Having a consistent hierarchy for the website allows other resources and software to deliver the content correctly.
