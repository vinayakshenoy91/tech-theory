- Same as fork join but emits value more often but requires atleast one value from each source to start emitting
- Keep emitting array values as and when it gets updated.
- If oe of them errors, the result will be an error and subscription will be closed.
An Observable created using the `forkJoin` function needs all source Observables to complete before emitting something. 
Also, combineLatest needs at least one value from each source before it emits something. This does not wait for completion and keeps 
providing value.



Syntax:
-------
combineLatest([observable1, observable2])
