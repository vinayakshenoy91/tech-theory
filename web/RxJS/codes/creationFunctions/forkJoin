Forkjoin creation function:
--------------------------
- For forkjoin, all the subscription has to complete before it emits a value
- Pass an array of obseravbles.
- Once you subscribe, it will provide subscription to all input obseravbles.
Used in case: Get all http response before proceed


forkJoin([A,B]) //A, B are observables.

A -> emit and complete
B -> emit and complete

Both will complete with individual subscription.
Then finally the forkJoin will emit an array with [Aresponse, Bresponse]


//It can be ajax or observable
forkJoin([ajax1$,ajax2$]).subscribe((ajaxResponses)=> console.log(ajaxResponses));
- Keep updating latest known values
