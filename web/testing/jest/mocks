- Mock function is a fake function that runs instead of real function
- Can assert on how many times mock ran and on which arguments
Mock purpose:
1) Prevent real function from running
2) Spy on function to see when it is called
3) Provide return values whihc can setup test conditions 

- No destruct on imports in non-test code

Spy: You still have original impl, but you can spy on if it is being called.
Mock: You can return certain predefined values.
