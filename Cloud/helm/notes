Readymade charts:

helm install wordpress


Concepts:
---------
- New revisions are created when you upgrade. When you rollback, 
it is taken to old config but revision number is incremented to next number.
Current chart is compared with previous chart to make a rollback decision.

- In helm 3, it does a 3-way strategic merge patch.
It looks at the old chart and then at the live state and then upgrades. Hence anything added is preseved.

Commands:
----------
- Install helm client

helm create msname
- Dependent charts -> put in charts folder

git checkout gh-pages

helm package ticekt-store
