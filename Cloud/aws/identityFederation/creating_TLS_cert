Steps to create TLS cert:
--------------------------
1) AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console
2) select the public certificate option
3) Next, letâ€™s enter our bare domain (e.g., the-good-parts.com) as well as a wildcard version 
of the domain (e.g., *.the-good-parts.com). The wildcard will cover our prod and staging subdomains.
4)If you chose DNS validation, you will reach a Validation step that asks you to add a CNAME record to your DNS hosted zone.
If you registered your domain through Route 53, you can simply click the Create record in Route 53 button to complete the validation process. 
Otherwise, you have to add the requested record to your DNS hosting service.
5)It usually takes a few minutes for the certificate to be validated. Once it is validated, you should see your issued certificate in the ACM console.
