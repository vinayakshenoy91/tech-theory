Step1:  EC2 -> Launch configs/Launch template ->create Ec2 instance
Step2: Create LB  -> Create TargetGroups to route traffic to servers
Step3: Create ASG-> use launch config [Name of ASG + network and subnets]  and add it the LB created above
Step 4: Goto ASG and assign target group -> Healthcheck on ELB

Flow:
ASG -> LB -> target group -> instance 



Get a mix of normal and spot instances.
-> Give sometime for instance to comeup and do healthchecks
