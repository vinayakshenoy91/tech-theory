- It is a network drive that you attach to one instance only
- Detach and attach volume to a diff instance in same AZ. Instance and EBS must be in same AZ
- Build in snspshot capability for incremental backup to S3
- Create AMI from snapshots to launch new EC2 instances.
- Volume is replicated within AZ
- EBS created at AZ level
- Built in snapshot capability for incremental backup to S3
- Creates volumes from snapshot(Any AZ in the region). Snapshot and restore in other AZ is the only option
- Copy snapshots to another region(DR, expansion)
- If multiple volumes attached to EC2, you can use one of the option:
- Volumes can be resized easily

1) Stop the system -> issue snapshot -> restart
2) Take backup at app level (using db s/w)
3) Use the multi-volume consistent snapshot.


Volume types:
--------------
-> gp2 -> General purpose
-> io 1 -> Provisoned IOPS(Expensive)
-> st 1 -> Throughput optimised HDD
-> sc1 -> Cold HDD, Infrequently accessed data


EBS snapshots:
--------------
- incremental and only backup changed blocks
- EBS backup use IO and you should not run them app is handling lot of traffic
- Sanpshot will be stored in S3 but you dont directly see them
- Not necessary to detach volumes to do a snapshot but is recommended
- can copy snapshots across region
- Can make Image(AMI) from snapshot
- EBS volumes restored by snapshots need to be prewarmed
- Snapshots can be automated using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager

EBS volumes:
------------
- For every 1TB increase you will get 3000IOPS upto 16000 IOPS
