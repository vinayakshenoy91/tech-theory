Usecase: Content management, web serving, data sharing, wordpress
- Compatible with libnux based system and is POSIX compliant
- uses: NFSv4.1 protocol
- Uses security group to control access to EFS drive
- Can only attach to one VPC, create one ENI(Mount target) per AZ
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- EFS scale to 1000+ concurrent connection. NFS client, 10GB+/s throughput
- grow to petabyte scale NFS

Performance mode: 
  - geenral purpose(default): Latency sensitive usecase
  - MAXIO - high latency, high throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)

Throughput mode:
  - Bursting mode: common for file systems (intensive works ,then almost nothing), linked to FS size
  - Provisioned IO mode: hih throughput to storage ratio (if burst is not enough) expensive
