- You can think of S3 as a highly-durable hash table in the cloud.
- The key can be any string, and the value any blob of data up to 5 TB.
- You can have as many parallel uploads and downloads as you want, thus, the infinite bandwidth.
- With S3, you pay $5/million uploads and $0.40/million downloads.
- One limitation of S3 is that you cannot append to objects.
- If you have something that’s changing rapidly (such as a log file), 
you have to buffer updates on your side for a while, and then periodically flush chunks to S3 as new objects.
A solution for this issue is to buffer data in a durable queue, such as SQS or Kinesis streams
- It doesn’t support HTTPS when used as a static website host
- A common mitigation is to always add your AWS account ID to the bucket name, which makes conflicts much less likely.
- S3 has an API to check if you own the bucket, and this should always be done before interacting with an existing S3 bucket.
- Max filesize is 5TB

- If you have a highly dynamic content in Us-east-1. There has been a need to make that data available 
with low latency in singapore-> use S3 CRR

- Trust Advisor to check bucket permission

4 methods to encrypt object in S3:
-----------------------------------
1) SSE-S3 -> Kys handled and managed by AWS
2) SSE-KMS -> KMS ot manage encryption keys
3) SSE-C -> When you want to manage your own encryption keys
4) Client side encryption keys
5) Glacier: All data is AES256 encrypted, key under aws control

Replication:
-------------
CRR -> Same content in another region with low latency
SRR

- S3 bucket versioning must be enabled -> If not, two writes then only 1 notification
- S3 event notification: By event or  object name filtering *.jpg
- By defautl cloudTrail records S3bucket level api calls. But we can enable CloudTrail Object level monitoring 

S3 pre-signed url:
------------------
- Issue a request as the person who presigned the url
- Ltd lifetime
- Uses IAM key of the signing IAM principal
