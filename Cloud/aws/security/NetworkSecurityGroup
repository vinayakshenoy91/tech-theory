Block public ip:
------------------
1) 1st line of defence is NACL -> Deny rule
2) Subset of ip allow in SG
3) Firewall software in Ec2
4) ALB sec group -> Ec2 shuld allow SG of ALB
- NLB does not do connection termination. So no SG.
- Use WAF for ip filtering at ALB level. I tis isntalledon ALB with bunch of rules
- At cloud front level use, cloud front geo restriction or WAF IP address filtering. NACL not helpful here.
- NACL sits at subnet level.It is stateless (Both inbound and outbound apply). Can only refer CIDR. New rules on NACL are all denial rules.

SG:
----
- Virtaul firewall for EC2
- SG belongs to a VPC. same Sg for both subnets
- Allow rules
- Stateful : return traffic explicitly allowed
- Applies to all instance within subnet
- Assign multiple SG to an instance.
- Source/Dest can be SG id or ip address
- /128 for single ipv6 address
- /32 for single IPV4
- SG from peered VPC can be referenced as an allowed source/destination
SG A inbound source SG B
- ::/0 -> IPV6

NACL
----
- Operates at subnet level
- Allow and deny rules
- Rules processed in numeric order
- Stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed.
