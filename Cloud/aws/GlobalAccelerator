- Unicast ip -> One server holds 1 ip
- Anycast ip -> All server has same ips and client is routed to nearest one.

- 2 anycast ips created for your app and they send traffic directly to edge location.
- Works with Elastic ip, Ec2 instance, ALB, NLB, public or private
- Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
- performs health check of your apps
- Failover to another AL in < 1 min
- Only two external ip to be whitelisted.
- DDOS protection via AWS shield

Good fit for:
- Non-http usecase like gaming(UDP), IOT, VOIP
- HTTP use case that require static ip address
- HTTP usecase that require deterministic, fas regional failovers.
