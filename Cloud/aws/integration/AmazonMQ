- Use case is when migrating from cloud, instead of  re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS,
we can use AmazonMQ. The traditional apps runnign on-premise may use open protocol like: MQTT, AMQp, STOMP,
Openwire, WSS
- Managed Apache active MQ
- It doesnt scale as much as SQS/SNS
- Amazon MQ runs on a dedicated machine , can run in HA with failover.
- Has both queue and topic feature
