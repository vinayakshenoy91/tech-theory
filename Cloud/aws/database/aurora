- Only upto 64 TB
- Work for MYSQL and Postgresql compatibility modes.
- 5 times faster than mysql
- 3 times fastr then postgres
- Global database
- Grows upto 64TB, 6 copies of data across 3 AZ, multiaz
- Read replicas -> 15RR, reader endpoint to access them all
- Cross region RR for DR-> Entire DB is copied
- Load/offload data directly from/to s3: effecient use of resources
- Backup, snapshot and restore, same as RDS 
- Storage is striped across 100 of volumes
- 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
- 3 copies of 6 need for reads
- Self healing with peer to peer replication
- Shared storage colume -> replication+ self healing + Auto expanding
- Auto failover for master in < 30s
- master + upto 15 aurora read replicas to serve reads


3 endpoints:-
-------------
1) Cluster Endpoint:
----------------------- 
- Points to current primary instance
- Suitable for reads and writes.

2) Reader endpoints:
---------------------
- Points to read replicas
- suitable for reads
- Multiple read replicas are LB

3) instance endpoints:
------------------------
- Points to individual aurora instances.



Aurora serverless:
-------------------
- Automated DB instantiation and autoscaling based on actual usage
- Good for infrequent internmittent or unpredicatable workloads
- Pay per sec

Global aurora:
---------------
- Aurora Global DB:
-> 1 primary region (read/write)
-> 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 sec
-> Upto 16 read replicas per secondary region
-> Helps decrease latency
-> Promoting another region (for DR) has RTO of < 1 min

Aurora Multimaster:
-------------------
- Immediat failover for write node (HA)
- Every node has R/W
