- AWS relation DB
- Push button scaling.
- 6 popular DB engines: Aurora, MySQL,PostgresSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server.
- Managed DB: Provison, backup [Automated point in time recovery. Backups expire] , monitoring, patching,
sanpshots[manual, can make copies of snapshots cross region]
- RDS is also guarded by security groups
- RDS events get notified via SNS
- MultiAz -> Standby instance for failover incase of outage. Sync replication with standby instance.
- One-DNS name and auto failover
- Scale reads using read replicas, Evetual consistency. Cross region
- Reads and writes to main DB and only reads from read replicas
- Copy an unencrypted RDS snapshot into and encrypted one

Security:
----------
- KMS at rest for EBS volumes and snapshots
- TDE(Transparent data encryption) for oracle and sql server
- SSl encryption for inflight
- IAM for postgres and mysql 
- Auth is within RDS

- Automatic backup can be taken in s3 and is for 35 days,
Last restorable time is typically withing last 5 min
- Point in time restore upto specified second.

- Snapshots are user initiated and kpt until explicitly deleted.Suitable for long term retention 
and copy to anotehr region.

- Read replica to offload read traffic from primary instance.
Data can be stale.

- RDS performs failover during compute scaling.Interruption to client for duration of failover.

- Zero downtime for storage scaling. SQL upto 16TB. Aurora 64TB. MYsql, Oracle and others upto 32TB

RDS permission and encryption:
-------------------------------
- IAM for control plane access - Who can create, manage, delete RDS instance.
- DB specific user for data plane access. Who can connect to DB and run SQL.
- Encryption at rest using KMS (Optional)
- Optional encrypted connection support using SSL/TLS
