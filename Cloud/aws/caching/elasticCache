- Elastic cache to get managed redis or memcached
- In-memory -> memcached and redis.
- Buffer high-freq writes and periodically reconcile with backend DB
- Deploy in your VPC
- used to store aggregated results

Memcached: 
----------
- Multinode for partitioning of data(sharding)
- Non-persistant
- No backup and restore
- Multithreaded architecture
- Key value  store
- scales upto 20 nodes and 12.7TB

Redis:
------
- Multi-AZ with autofailover
- Read replicas to scale reads and have high availability
- Use advanced DS
- Strings, lists, sorted sets, Hash , Bit arrays
- Built in command for geospatial data
- Scales upto 250 nodes 170 TB
- Pub Sub and messaging
- Read replica across multiple AZ
- Detect primary failure and promotes replica as primary
- Persistant, Data durability: Read only File Feature(AOF), backup and restore.
