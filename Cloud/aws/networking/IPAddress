- VPC require IP range and is defined using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block
- Allowed block size is between /16 and /28

10.0.0.0/16 -> 65535 address (10.0.0.0.-10.0.255.255)
10.0.0.0/28 -> 16 address (10.0.0.0-10.0.0.15)

CIDR.xyz can be used to calculate first and last ip and available ips

Subnet block -> 10.0.0.0/20
AWS reserves first 4 and last address of each subnet block
.0,.1,.2,.3,.15.255

- Subsets of VPC CIDR and they should not overlap
Subnet 1 -> 10.0.0.4-10.0.15.254
subnet 2 -> 10.0.16.4 - 10.0.31.254

- Instance address determined by subnet CIDR

External IP address assigned by AWS from pool of pulbic ip address. Incase you want same ip, use elastic ip
Elastic ip can be reassigned

- Elastic IP has to be assigned to a running instance and it is free. If you keep it idle it will be charged.

Internal:
---------
- Addressable from inside VPC only
- based on subnet CIDR
- Stays same for lifetime of instance.

External:
----------
- Addressable from outside of VPC
- Can change on instance start or stop
- Pulled from AWS pool of external IPs
