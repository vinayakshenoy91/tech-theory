KeyVault:
----------
- You can give permissions to encryption keys, secret and certificates
- Enable disk volume encryption, ARM template deployment and azure 
VM for deployment keys can be set from vault.
- Can do networking setup as to which endpoint can access kv
- You need to create a ServicePrincipal to give access to kv 

Programatically:
----------------
- You need to know the url of the vault [Get it from that particular vault overview]
- Go to Azure AD -> App registration -> name of app -> register
- From overview screen,  get the client id and tenant id (AD tenant id)
- For client secret -> goto cert and secret -> new client secret -> value of secret
- Now use these in your app
- Authorize the app -> goto kv -> access policy -> select principal


For making it private: (only element inside vnet to have access)
----------------------
- Goto vnet -> svc endpoint -> add -> choose kv -> choose subnet
- Goto KV -> Networking -> private endpoint/ selected networks -> save
