Http2:

Using HTTP/2 based services can help to improve performance of exchanges by supporting binary compression and framing. The binary framing layer is transparent to the developer, but behind the scenes will split and compress the message into smaller chunks. The advantage of binary framing is it allows for a full request and response multiplexing over a single connection. Consider processing a list in another service and the requirement is to retrieve 20 different attendees, if we retrieved these as individual HTTP/1 requests it would require the overhead of creating 20 new TCP connections. Multiplexing allows us to perform 20 individual requests over a single HTTP/2 connection.

gRPC uses HTTP/2 by default and reduces the size of exchange by using a binary protocol. If bandwidth is a concern or cost gRPC will provide an advantage, in particular as content payloads increase significantly in size. gRPC may be beneficial compared to REST if payload bandwidth is a cumulative concern or the service exchanges large volumes of data. If large volumes of data exchanges are frequent it is also worth considering some of the asynchronous capabilities of gRPC,
