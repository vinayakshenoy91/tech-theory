TCP:
----

- Websockets 
- HTTP : REST , GRPC, Graphql

- It is reliable, ordered , error-checked
- Slower than other protocols
- Checksum is basically size of message, if part of it gets corrupted. Checksum is calculated by recevied and then compared with what sender sent.


UDP:
----
- Faster than TCP as there is no ordering etc
- Out of order and unreliable.
- Good for constant stream of data 
- Moinitoring metrics, Video streaming, gaming

Qn to be asked: Is it ok to loose data?


HTTP:
-----
- Layer 7

Long polling:
------------
- Real time message delivery
- Good option if websockets are not an option. Set long lived connection and then close connection when you get message and then again open it

gRPC:
-----
- Invoke another servcice as it is a local function call
- Function is described in IDL
Generator takes description as input and creates impl in particular language.
Uses Protobuf as IDL
-gRPC is binary protocol and RPC is text based protocol


Questions for protocol:
-----------------------
grpc not good option for external client
UDP protocol for collecting metrics from diff servers
