Browser -> makes DNS query -> IP address of a machine

Source ip in the http request will be used to send the response

- 192.168.x.y -> private machine

- Machine has 0 to 65535 ports
0-1023 -> reserved as system ports

22 -> secure shell
53 -> DNS lookup
80-> http
443-> https


DNS:
----
- Entities and protocols involved in the translation from domain names to ip addresses.

IP:
---
- Internet protocol. How machine to machine comm should happen inthe world

TCP:
---
- Network protocol built on top of IP
- Allows for ordered, reliable data delivery between machines over the public Internet by creating a connection.
- Implemented in kernel whihc exposes sockets to applications that they can use to stream data hrough an open connection

HTTP:
-----
- Implemented on top of TCP
Contains host, port , method , headers , body
We have request-response pattern here and forget about underlying things,

IP packet = ip header[Source address, dest address , other info related to network] + payload 
They are only 2^16 bytes -> 0.66MB


TCP packet =  ip header[Source address, dest address , other info related to network] + TCP header [Ordering] + payload 

First interaction happens through TCP handshake and connection is established.
If timeout or message sent from one of them that TCP connection is going to close/end.

An HTTP header that does not relate to the content of the message is a response header. A request-header is used to provide information about requests or responses. The Entity-header field defines meta-information about the body. The general syntax for all the header fields is msg-header=field-name “:” [field-value]

The General-header field is for both response and request.


For passing additional information about the request we use request-header fields. These are also requested modifiers. There are several request-header fields like Accept-Encoding, Expect, Accept-Charset, Accept-Language, Form, Host, Authorization, If-Match, Proxy-Authorization, Range, User-Agent, TE, Referer, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Range.


For passing additional information about the response that can’t be placed in Status-Line, we use response-header fields. Some of the fields are Age, Accept-Ranges, Location, ETag, WWW-Authenticate, Vary, Server, Retry-After.
