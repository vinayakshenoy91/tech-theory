- Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images —consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set 
of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label.

Steps to be followed in ML:
-----------------------------
1) Importing the libraries
2) Using some pre-defined utility functions
3) Loading the data
4) Cleaning the data
5) Dividing the dataset into training and test dataset using train_test_split in the ratio 85:15
6) Training several models and analyzing their performance to select a model
7) Use dimensionality reduction to improve the ‘training’,
‘fine-tuning’ and ‘prediction’ time.
8) Fine-tuning the model by finding the best hyper-parameters and features
9) Evaluating selected model using test dataset
