Semisupervised learning:
------------------------
- Some algorithms can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data 
and a little bit of labeled data. This is called semisupervised learning.

Ex: Google photos:
This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all
the system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just one label per person,4
and it is able to name everyone in every photo, which is useful for searching photos.

- Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and
supervised algorithms. For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsu‐
pervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) stacked on top of
one another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the
whole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.


Reinforcemnt Learning:
----------------------
- The learning system, called an agent in this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get
rewards in return  (or penalties in the form of negative rewards).
-  It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most reward over time. A policy 
defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a given situation.

Ex: DeepMind’s AlphaGo program
