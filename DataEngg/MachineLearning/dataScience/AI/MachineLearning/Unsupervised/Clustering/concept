Kmeans Clustering:
------------------
- Cluster the data on given number of centroid

Steps:
------
1) Initilize the centroid randomly
2) For each instance:
   -> Pick a centroid from which the instance is at shortest distance.
   -> Assign the instance the group
   -> Recalaculate that centroid

3) Keep repeat the step 2 until no instance changes the group.


- Complexity of k means clustering is O(n*m*centroid_num)

- Inertia: Closeness between instances and centre
