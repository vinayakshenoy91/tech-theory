- The training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called Labels

Typical tasks of supervised learning includes:
---------------------------------------------
- classification
- regression -> Predict a target using predictors/features

Note: Logistic Regression is commonly used for classification, as it can
output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class.

Some supervised learning algos are:
------------------------------------
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural networks






- Task of identifying to which category an observation belongs to.
Ex: Email spam or not, species of iris flowers based on petal length, credit card txn frad/genuine.

- Binary and Multiclass classification

MNIST dataset [Modified National Institute of Standard and Tech]. It is hello world of ML.
When people come with algo, they test it against MNIST dataset.

- SGD classifier follows OvA strategy for multi-class classification.
- SGD and linear classifiers are binary classifiers.
- The greater the value for ROC AUC [Max value 1], better the model.



Steps for machine learning classification is:
---------------------------------------------
1) Divide dataset into training and test sample.
2) Train classifier using training set.
3) Test using testing set.
4) Performance metrice[Finalize model]
5) Improve model using error analysis

Binary classifier:
-----------------
- Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups
on the basis of classification rule.

Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) Classifier:
---------------------------------------------
- Capable of handlign large datasets
- Deals with training instances independently
- Well suited for online training

It implements:
- a plain SGD routine
- supports diff loss functions
- penalties for classification

- Gradient descent: Instead of trying all lines, go intot he direction that yield better results.
Measure the slope and move on.
