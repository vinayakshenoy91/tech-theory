Why ML?
--------
- Lot of data
- Lot of rules
- Hard permutation and combination
- Uknown rules

Most part is : collect, curate and define task -> Chossing appropriate algo(ML engineer) -> ML research(Fast, Effecient and Better ways)


Six elements of ML:
--------------------
1) Data:
--------
- Do you have both input and output
- All data in numbers and high dimensions
- Has x and y

Dataset sites:
--------------
- Google AI
- data.gov.in
- UCI

Figure eight, data turks, amazon mechnical turks -> curate data
wiki data

2) Tasks:
---------
- Identify the task that you could do with the data.
- Can be classification and regresssion

3) models: Writing eqn:
-----------------------
- Come up with diff functions to model the task
- Control complexity of model

4) Loss function:
-----------------
- See how good or bad the model is
- sum of square of diff

KL divergence
Square error loss
Cross entropy loss

- Find  coeff, a,b,c such that loss fn is minimised
- Many optimisation solvers do this.
- Calculus and linear algebra required.
- Try out with various functions as well

5) Evaluate the model:
----------------------
- 1 time accuracy
- Top 3 accuracy
- Precision and recall
- Evaluate on test data

Supervised learning:
--------------------
- you provide labelled Dataset
Linear regresssion; Continuous data, demand forecasting
Logistic: Clasification data
- Always has one or multiple targets associated with it.
- Here we are required to predict a value.


Unsupervised:
-------------
- Clustering sort of algo
- Customer segmentation
- Does not have any target variable.
