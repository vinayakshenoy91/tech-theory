- Powerful opensource lib for numerical computations
- Fine tuned for large scale ML
- Train ML model with few lines of code
- Provides a python api  called TF.Learn(tensorflow.contrib.learn)
- TF.Learn is compatible with Scikit-Learn
- Api built on top of tensorflow called Keras, Pretty Tensor
- Has a visualization tool called TensorBoard


Managing graph:
----------------
- Any node that we create is added to the default graph
- x1 = tf.Variable(1)
- x1.graph is tf.get_default_graph() //True
