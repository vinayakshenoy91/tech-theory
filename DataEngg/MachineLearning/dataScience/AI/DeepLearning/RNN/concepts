- 2D data to be interpreted visually can be done well with CNN
- RNN can work on sequence of arbitrary lengths rather than fixed size inputs.

Applications:
--------------
- Analyse time series data like stock prices.
- Autonomous driving where it can be used to anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents.
- Can take sentences,documents,  or audio samples as input and make them extremenlyh useful.
- For NLP system like, automatic translation, speech-to-text or sentiment analysis.
- Autoreply email [What to suggest next], you use RNN
- Google's Magenta project to predict the next melody.

Features of RNN:
---------------
- RNN looks much like a feedforward neural network except it also has connections pointing backwards.
- Since the output of a recurrent neuron at time step t is a function of all the inputs from previous time steps,
We can say that it has a form of memory.
- A part of neural network that preserves some state across time steps is called a Memory cell.
- Call state at time step t , denoted h(t) us a function of some inputs at that time step and its
state at the previous time step h(t)=f(h(t-1),x(t))
- Its output at time step t, denoted y(t) is also a Function of the previous state and the current inputs.
- RNN can take a sequence of inputs and produce a sequence of outputs. This kind of network is useful for predicting  time series.
We feed it the prices over the last N days and It must output the prices shifted by one day intot he future.
- Sequence of vector network is used for movie review as we get a sentiment score from it.
