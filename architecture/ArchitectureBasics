Architecture framework:
-----------------------
1. TOGAF
2. Zachman framework
3. Gartner
4. Federal enterprise arch framework

C4 -> It is a solution arch modelling technique to illustrate software arch within one single diagram

Solution arch fundamentals:
--------------------------
Duties:
------
- Sprint zero arch
- Detailed doc
- contribute to best practises


Process:
--------
1) Understand hihg level business reqt
    
2) Create IT arch vision :  The purpose of creating a IT Architecture Vision, 
is to provide business with enough information and solution options that will meet their high level requirements.

3) Understand detailed business requirement
4) Develop soln arch
5) Review soln arch
6) Govern solution delivery process and monitor


Agile arch framework:
----------------------
1) SAFe-Scaled Agile Framework
2) TOGAF The Open Group Agile Arch Framework Standards (O-AAF Standard)

Outcome artifacts:
------------------
1) Sprint Zero Document
2) Soln arch diagram
The logical solution architecture describe your business stakeholders, which users are impacted, 
the organization and/or business capability impacted, 
the applications and its components, and the data and the data flows between the system components.

Sprint zero architecture or IT arch vision:
-------------------------------------------
1) Problem statement:
- Concerns of business
- Key stakeholders
- Business capability or value streams impacted.

2) Business Vision statement:
- Agree to desired outcome of the architecture.

3) Change drivers and opportunities:
- Vision of the target arch
- Decision made
- Potential opportunities

4) Business capability impact
- capability model
- show capability impact
- What cpabilities are impacted? New or is this something changed.

5) Business and tech objectives
- Migrate, replace, decomission

6) Arch vision
- Principles, assumptions and constraints.
- Arch principles applied
- As is conceptual arch
- To be conceptual arch

7) High level NFR:
- constraints and restrictions
- Perf
- availaiblity
- Volumes
- User interactions
- Business continuity
- Security
- Ops and monitoring
- Networking
- User interface requirement
- Arch requirement

8) Proposed solution options
- high level options
- buy vs build
- tech options
- arch guidence and Standards

9) Timelines and costing
- Rough estimate
- Feasibility
- Budget
- Timelines
- Tech and licence
