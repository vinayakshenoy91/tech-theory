- Subdomain is a sub-part of your overall business domain.It is a single, logical domain model.
Under DDD, subdomain should be impl as a clean bounded context.
- Most optimal model is on subdomain per bounded context and one bounded context per subdomin.
- When using DDD, a Bounded Context should align one-to-one (1:1) with a single Subdomain. That is, when using DDD, 
if there is one Bounded Context, there is, as a goal, one Subdomain model in that Bounded Context. It may not always 
be possible or practical to achieve, but where possible it is important to design in that way. 
This will keep your Bounded Contexts clean and focused on the core strategic initiative.

Types of subdomain:
--------------------
1) Core domain: This is where you are making a strategic investment in a single, well-defined domain model, 
committing significant resources for carefully crafting your Ubiquitous Language in an explicit Bounded Context.
This is very high on your organization’s list of projects because it will distinguish it from all competitors.

2) Supporting Subdomain: This is a modeling situation that calls for custom development, 
because an off-the-shelf solution doesn’t exist.
You may want to consider outsourcing this kind of Bounded Context to avoid mistaking it for something strategically 
distinguishing, and thus investing heavily in it. 
This is still an important software model, because your Core Domain cannot be successful without it.

3) Generic Subdomain: This kind of solution may be available for purchase off the shelf but may also be outsourced 
or even developed in house by a team that doesn’t have  the kind of elite developers that you assign to your 
Core Domain or even a lesser Supporting Subdomain
