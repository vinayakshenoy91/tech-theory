 They all share a set of common characteristics:

Platforms are self-service: You don't need to go to a store or ring a call center in order to create a Facebook or Amazon account, or upload pictures or products. It's all done online through self-service. Even if you need to learn how to do something, there will be online tutorials and interactive guides.
Platforms enable us to connect and interact: Users of the platform can connect with each other and interact almost instantaneously and without the need for third parties.
Platforms create value: Throughout all the interactions that occur in the platform, value is created. For example, the Amazon platform allows its users to publish their own products so others can find and buy them. This creates value for the users that publish products, for the buyers who ideally find a great deal, and for Amazon, as the platform owner, in addition to a fee that is typically charged for the transaction and service.
