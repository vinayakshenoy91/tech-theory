Compaction:
-----------
Compaction is performed by the event broker to reduce the size of its internal logs by retaining only the most recent event 
for a given key. Older events of the same key will be deleted, and the remaining events compacted down into a new and smaller 
set of files.The event stream offsets are maintained such that no changes are required by the consumers
