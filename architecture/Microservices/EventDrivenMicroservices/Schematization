Schematization selections such as Apache Avro and Googleâ€™s Protobuf provide two features that are leveraged heavily in 
event-driven microservices. First, they provide an evolution framework, where certain sets of changes can be safely made 
to the schemas without requiring downstream consumers to make a code change. Second, they also provide the means to generate 
typed classes (where applicable) to convert the schematized data into plain old objects in the language of your choice.
