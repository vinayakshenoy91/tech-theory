Defn:
-----

- Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
- Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

When to use facade?
--------------------
- This approach works only when using a subset of the systemâ€™s capabilities or when interacting 
with it in a particular way.


Features:
--------
Intent

You want to simplify how to use an existing system. You need to define your own interface.

Problem

You need to use only a subset of a complex system. Or you need to interact with the system in a particular way.

Solution

The Facade presents a new interface for the client of the existing system to use.

Participants and collaborators

It presents a simplified interface to the client that makes it easier to use.

Consequences

The Facade simplifies the use of the required subsystem. However, because the Facade is not complete, certain functionality may be unavailable to the client.

Implementation

Define a new class (or classes) that has the required interface.

Have this new class use the existing system.

Variations on Facade: Reduce the number of objects a client must work with
