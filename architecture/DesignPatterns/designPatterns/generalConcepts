- instantiation is an activity that shouldnâ€™t always be done in public and can often lead to coupling problems.
- You separate what frequently change to what is static.


The following guidelines can help you avoid OO designs that violate the Dependency Inversion Principle:

1) No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class.
2) No class should derive from a concrete class.
3) No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes.


Patterns:
---------

1) Incase of static class:

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println(Utensil.NAME + Dessert.NAME);

    }
    private static class Utensil {

        static final String NAME = "pan";

    }

    private static class Dessert {

        static final String NAME = "cake";

    }
}
