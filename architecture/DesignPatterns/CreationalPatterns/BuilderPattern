- Separate construction of a complex object from its representation so that smae construction process
can create different representation
- Isolate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- Algo of creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and 
how they are assembled.
- The construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed.
- Person constructor is private and can be accessed from the Builder.
- Note you can create diff builder like ChildBuilder and AdultBuilder

Ex in JDK:
----------
- java.lang.StringBuilder#append() (unsync)
- java.lang.StringBuffer#append()(sync)
- All impl of java.lang.Appendable


new Person.Builder("Hello").build();


public static class Builder {
  
   private Person person;

   public Builder(String name){
      person = nwe Person();    
      person.name=name;
   }

   public Builder setPlace(String place){
       person.place=place;
       return this;
   }

   public Person build(){
       return person;
   }

}
