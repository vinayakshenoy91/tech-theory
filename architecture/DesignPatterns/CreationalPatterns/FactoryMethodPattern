- How to encapsulate the creation and initilization of the object, if it can have different types?
- define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
The Factory method lets a class defer instatiation it uses to subclasses.

- Have an abstract method that allows us to delegate into subclasses the decision of 
which concrete type to return.

public class UKCarFactory extends CarFactory{
    protected Car createCar(){
        return new LeftSideSteerWheelCar();
    }
}
