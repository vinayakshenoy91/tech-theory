Distributed locking is also used at a much more granular level in some distributed databases, such as Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) [18]. RAC uses a lock per disk page, with multiple nodes sharing access to the same disk storage system. Since these linearizable locks are on the critical path of transaction execution, RAC deployments usually have a dedicated cluster interconnect network for communication between database nodes.
