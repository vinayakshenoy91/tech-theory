- A quorum is the minimum number of servers on which a distributed operation needs to be performed successfully 
before declaring the operationâ€™s overall success.

- Quorum enforces the consistency requirement needed for distributed operations.

- Value of quorum : N/2 + 1

- Quorum is achieved when nodes follow the below protocol: R + W > N, where:
NN = nodes in the quorum group
WW = minimum write nodes
RR = minimum read nodes

- Best performance (throughput/availability) when 1 < r < w < n1<r<w<n, because reads are 
more frequent than writes in most applications
