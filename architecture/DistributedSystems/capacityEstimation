- Depends on Number of txn, availability , amount of data to be stored

million -> 10^6
billion -> 10^9
trillion -> 10^12

1million/ day = 12/sec , 700/min, 4200/hr

- Read/write heavy
- Number of txn -> latency of system
- Huge data transfer
- Network bandwidth
- Number of request and servers needed
- LB handle so many request


Latency: Time it takes for a certain ops to complete
Throughput -> The numner of operations  that a system can handle properly per unit time.
(Request per second /QPS)
