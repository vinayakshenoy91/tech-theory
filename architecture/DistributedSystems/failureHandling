1) Problem:
Identify POST is for new creation second time or it was tried due to a failure retry

Solved using client id:
1) Create GUID at client side
2) Call POST with that GUID -> inserted -> return call fails due to network error
3) Client tries again with that id and  app will see that it is already inserted and just returned a 201 CREATED
