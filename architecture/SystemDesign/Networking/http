http 1.1:
--------
- New TCP connection is first established
- Headers are passed in plain text
- Works on top of TCP
- Multiple TCP connection and reuse them


http 2:
--------
- Interleave multiple request response in same connection
- logical breaking connection to multiple streams.
- headers are compressed
- One single TCP connection for sending multiple parallel request -> this is multiplexing
- This is a binary protocol
- Here you have to send data via HEADERS frmae and DATA frame
- Header compression ,ie, send only changed info.
- Flow control is present  -> Sender will not send too much info when receiver cannot handle it.
We can send it as straming request/response.
- It has multiplexing


There are basically three main features of the HTTP protocol:

HTTP is media independent,
HTTP is connectionless, and
HTTP is stateless also.
The browser initiates an HTTP request, and then a client disconnects from the server.
