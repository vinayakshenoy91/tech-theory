- Event can be notification or persistent records -> Both stating something happened.
- Use time series data base when  data sent from sensor

Stream processing -> Persistent and notification
- Actor models / message brokers
- continous queries/Stream queries
- Incremental materialized view

Stream processing -> If windowed -> Stream analytics, complex event processing
If not windowed, Database replication materialized views


Event 
------
- Replication can be done using: Log based event mechanism and is appended to the end.
- Follower will read the logs and apply it

How to construct a log?
- designated primary
- consensus algo [Paxos or rafto] -> Automated change to leader

- Every replicate process events in same order.
Cost: Every log append requires round trip to leader (and quorum incase of consensus protocol)
Timestamp ordering still gives is a total order one events.
