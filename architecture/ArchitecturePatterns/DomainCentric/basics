- Hexagonal architecture is domain centric architecture.
- Onion architecture [Domain -> domain svc -> app svc]

- Cons: REquires more thought on whihc classes lie where like in app vc layer or domainsvc 

- Centers the dev to a programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain.

- Should be applied to only complex domains where the model and the lingustic processes provide
clear benefits in the communication of complex info and in the formulation of common understanding of the domain.

- Business domian complexity only not tech complexity
