- Event Sourcing can be described as persisting all Domain Events that have occurred for an Aggregate instance as a 
record of what changed about that Aggregate instance. Rather than persisting the Aggregate state as a whole, 
you store all the individual Domain Events that have happened to it.

- As new Domain Events occur for a given Aggregate instance, they are appended to the end of its event stream. 
Reapplying the event stream to the Aggregate allows its state to be reconstituted from persistence back into memory. 
In other words, when using Event Sourcing, an Aggregate that was removed from memory for any reason is reconstituted 
entirely from its event stream.

- Stream id, stream version, Event type, Event content

- The event store is just a sequential storage collection or table where all Domain Events are appended. 
Because the event store is append-only, it makes the storage mechanism extremely fast, so you can plan on a 
Core Domain that uses Event Sourcing to have very high throughput, low latency, and be capable of high scalability.


- One of the greatest advantages of using Event Sourcing is that it saves a record of everything that has ever 
happened in your Core Domain, at the individual occurrence level. This can be 
very helpful to your business for many reasons, ones that you can imagine today, such as compliance and analytics.
