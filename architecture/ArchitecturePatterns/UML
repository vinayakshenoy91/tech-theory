Types of modelling:
--------------------
a) Structural modelling:
- Identify physical and conceptual parts
- static parts
- Nouns

Diagrams:
---------
1) Class:
- Vocab
- Relationship
- Composiiton is like the entity is not standalone until it is tied to its parent.
Composition -> contained object is a part of the containing object
This is an unshared association, with the contained objectâ€™s lifetime being controlled by its containing object. 
- Aggregation -> contained objects are more like collection of things.



2) Component:
- Identify interfaces
- Define replaceble parts

3) Package:
- logical container
- support large models


4) Deployment
- visualize hardware and network dependencies
- Map components to physical systems
- view special devices


b) Behavioural modelling:
--------------------------
Functionality - Processes and interactions
Dynamic parts
Verbs

Diagram:
-------
1) Use case:
- Identify user task
- System interactions
2) Sequence
- Object interactions
- Focus on time order

3) State:
- Model states of an Object
- Reactive objects
- Internal behaviour

4) Activity
