The process is simple:
1.Understand all the business requirements.
2.Make a conscious effort to understand the future vision of the company as well as the project.
3.List all technical, functional and non-functional requirements.
4.Create an architecture that encompasses everything from 1-3.
5.Brainstorm on how to fail it by identifying:
  a.Failures,b.Bottlenecks,c.Downtime.
6.Come up with an architectural solution to the problems identified in 5. 
7.Add it to the architecture and create a better pattern.
8.Repeat the process (steps 3-7) until we come up with an architectural pattern that works.
9.Use these principles to create a modern architecture.

Good architects think about encapsulating logic, using dependency injection, use generics, and make it reusable.

-Look at opportunity of offline processing based on unit of work pattern.
