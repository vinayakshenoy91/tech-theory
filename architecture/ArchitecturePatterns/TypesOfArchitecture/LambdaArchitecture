- Provides best of both worlds by providing batch vs real time processing
- Nathan marz came up with this arch
Balance between:
- High fault tolerance and comprehensive analysis from batch processing
- Low latency (from real time processing)

Three layer:
- Batch, speed and serving layer

Data coming in is dispatched to batch and speed layer.

Batch layer (Output is batch view)
- Manager dataset and be a system of records
- Precompute batch views

Speed layer (Output is real time view): Queue + processing = Real time
- Operates only on the most recent data
- Doesnt attempt to provide a complete view or make any complex data corrections

Serving layer -> Serves the queries by merging both batch views and real time views.
