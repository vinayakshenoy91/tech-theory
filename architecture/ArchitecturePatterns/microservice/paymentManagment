For one of my recent clients, a payment company weâ€™ll call PaymentCo, the use of certain types of data directly influenced the decisions we made about system decomposition. PaymentCo handle credit card data, and as a result it means that their system needed to comply to various requirements set down by Payment Card Industry (PCI) about how this data needs to be managed. As part of this, their system and processes needed to be audited. They had a need to handle the full credit card data, and at a volume that meant their system had to comply with PCI Level 1, which is the most stringent level, and requires quarterly external assessment of the systems and practices related to how this data is managed.
