Rules:
-----
1) Make sure details are defintely true or false.
2) Data model remains for long and should be designed carefully
3) Lucid chart for entities -> Draw ER diagram
4) Identify nouns and convert
5) Normalize DB - Put design in standard format.
Why Normalize? -> Eliminate inconsistencies, Remove duplicate info, Improve perf.

1st Normal form:
------------------
1) Each set of columns must uniquely identify a row.
2) A combination of all columns must be unique.
3) See what columsn can be used to uniquely identify a record if not create a new primary key column

2nd normal form:
----------------
- Should fulfil the requirements of first normal form + each non-key attributes must be functionally 
dependent on the primary key.
- Foreign key -> used to link two tables together. It is a primary key in another table.

1) Define relationships
2) Types of relationships are:
a) one to many
b) one to one
c) Many to many -> stored in a join table
d) Self relationship -> relationship that where a table joins to itself.Two record in one table.


3rd normal form:
----------------
1) Fulfil the requirement of 2nd normal form and has not transitive dependencies.
2) Colum A> Column B > Column C So Column A > Column C -> These kinds should be removed.



Design considerations:
----------------------
1) Datatypes and precision
2) Data integrity to make sure data is complete and accurate.
[null, not null, data range]
3) Use camelCase or underscore.
table_id
4) Lookup table and auditing
5) Auditing table -> created_by, updated_date, created_date, created_by
