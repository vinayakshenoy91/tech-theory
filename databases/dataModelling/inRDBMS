Relational databases use Normalization, which is a technique used to provide the following benefits.
1.	
To prevent duplication of data.

 
2.	
Enforcing real-life relationships so data is organized into logical groupings.

 
3.	
So that changes can be made in one place thereby making updates to the data easier and faster.

 
4.	
Preserving the integrity of the data
Normalization slows retrieval with the increased number of tables involved.
