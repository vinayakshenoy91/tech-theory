- Atomicity - Txn is sequence od operation that for an external observer should appear as a single operation
- Consistency -> A txn that wasalready committed is seen by all future queries/txn
Also does not violate any constraints that we set for our data.
- Isolation -> Two concurrent txn do not see each otehr state.
- RDBMS guarantee acid



Choosing a right DB:
--------------------



Non-relational DB:
-----------------
1) Key value store
2) Document store: 
- More structure inside each document.
- Each document is an object with different attributes and attributes can be of different types.
3) Graph DB: Link, traverse and analyse records more effeciently
Usecases: Fraud detection, Recommendation engines, 

Non-relational DB considerations:
- Query speed
- Perfect choice for caching
- Real time big data
- Data is not structured

Key/Value Stores Examples
Redis

Aerospike

Amazon DynamoDB

Document Store Examples
Cassandra

MongoDB

Graph Databases Examples
Amazon Neptune

NEO4J

Speed up DB operations:
------------------------
1) Indexing - Primary and compiste index
We are making read queries faster
Additional space is required for storing the index tables
Speed of write operations

2) database replication - Fault tolerant and reduce risk of data loss.
tradeoff : High complexity when it comes to operations like write, update and delete
Concurrent modifications don't conflict with each other
Provides guarantees in terms of Consistency and correctness

3) Database partitioning or sharding

- Diff queries can be performed in parallel
- Better perf and high scalability
- In RDBMS, this is challenging as Queries involving multiple records are spread across multiple machines
- when choosing RDMBMS for a high volume data, make sure paritioning is well supported.
