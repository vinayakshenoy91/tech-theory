Text analysis process:
-----------------------
Tokenize(chope and drop punctuation,tags,etc) 
Reduce to common case (all upper or lower case)
Remove stop words(Words more common like in/on etc),
Reduce to common stems (remove plurals, common endings)
Aling to common language form

Design steps:
-------------
Index - what should be searchable - Doctypes and fields to index, Map fields and sections, Comfigure field settings.
Analyse - How text segmented and filtered - Filter for unwanted chars, split input into segments = tokenize, filter out tokenized inputs.
Search - how will queries run - choose approach, run queries with modifiers, sequence results by field/score/by facets.
REsults - Evaluate result compared to previous searches.
