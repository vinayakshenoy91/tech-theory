- If we need to store the elements in sorted order, we can use sorted sets, also known as ZSets, in Redis.
Now, the important thing to note is how the element will be sorted. Each element should be assigned a score 
before it is inserted into a sorted set. The Redis database sorts the elements in ascending order of this score.
