- The Redis database internally stores List as a linked list. This linked list has a head and tail. 
Whenever we insert a new element, we can insert it either at the head or tail. The ‘head’ of the list is considered 
as the left-most element of the list and the ‘tail’ is considered as right-most element of the list.



- LPUSH key value… -> Adds value at head of lsit

- LRANGE key start end

LRANGE cars 0 -1

- LPOP key -> The LPOP command is used to remove an element from the list. This command removes the element at the head, i.e., the left of the list.


- rpush key value… -> RPUSH command is used to insert a value at the tail of the list. 

- rpop key


- LLEN key

- LINDEX key index

- LSET key index value

- LPUSHX key value -> The lpushx command adds an element to the head of the list if the list exists.

- linsert key before/after pivot value -> This command is useful if we need to insert an element before a particular element.
