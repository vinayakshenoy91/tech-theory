- Redis supports a very basic security system to protect the connection between the client and the server via a plain-text password. 
To secure Redis, the password should be set in the config file.

- Redis only supports basic security mechanisms. Anyone who knows the password can access the data in Redis. 
It is not possible to have users with different permission levels in Redis.

Check if password enabled:
--------------------------
config get requirepass

config set requirepass password //Configure password if not done

auth password //Authenticate next time

1.Add the following command to the redis.conf file.
