This is a dynamic programming[1] question. Usually, solving and fully understanding a dynamic programming problem is a 4 step process:

Start with the recursive backtracking solution
Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down[2] dynamic programming)
Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming)
Apply final tricks to reduce the time / memory complexity
All solutions presented below produce the correct result, but they differ in run time and memory requirements.
