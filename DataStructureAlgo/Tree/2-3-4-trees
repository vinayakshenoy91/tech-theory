2-3-4 is a search tree which is an advanced version of 2-3 Trees. This tree can accommodate more keys 
and hence more child nodes as compared to 2-3 Trees. Likewise, a 2-3-4 Tree satisfies all the properties covered 
in 2-3 Trees as well as some additional key features:

Each internal node can contain a max. of three keys

Each internal node can have a max. of four child nodes

In the case of three keys (left, mid, and right) at an internal node, all the keys present at the LeftChild node 
are smaller than the left key. This can be mathematically expressed as,

LeftChild.keys < LeftKeyLeftChild.keys<LeftKey

All the keys present at the LeftMidChild node are smaller than the mid key, which can be mathematically expressed as,
LeftMidChild.keys < MidKeyLeftMidChild.keys<MidKey

All the keys present at the RightMidChild node are smaller than the right key, which can be mathematically expressed as,
RightMidChild.keys < RightKeyRightMidChild.keys<RightKey

Finally, all the keys present at the RightChild node are greater than the right key, which can be mathematically expressed as,
RightChild.keys > RightKeyRightChild.keys>RightKey
