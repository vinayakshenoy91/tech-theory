- LIFO

Applications:
--------------
- There are many computer algorithms like Depth First Search and Expression Evaluation Algorithm, etc.,
- To backtrack to the previous task/state, e.g., in a recursive code
- To store a partially completed task, e.g., when you are exploring two different paths on a Graph from a 
point while calculating the smallest path to the target.

Function - Description
push	Inserts an element at the top
pop	Removes an element from the top and returns it
isFull	Returns true if the stack is full and false otherwise
isEmpty	Returns true if the stack is empty and false otherwise
top	Returns the element at the top (i.e., the one added most recently)

Impl:
-----
stacks are generally implemented 
using arrays because it takes less space; we don’t need to store an additional pointer like in a linked list.

Complexities of Stack Operations #
Let’s look at the time complexity of each stack operation.

Operation	Time Complexity
isEmpty	O(1)
top	O(1)
size	O(1)
push	O(1)
pop	O(1)
