Coding best practise:
----------------------
1) Caps for constants: WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK
2) Name factory as : ShapeFactory
3) Class name should not be a verb and should always be noun.Avoid words like Manager, 
Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class.
4) Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment, deletePage, or save. Accessors, mutators, 
and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get, set, and is according to the javabean standard.
5) When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments.
Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
6) A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.
7) Use tech names or pboelm names appropriately
8) If multiple variables are related, make them as part of a single class and use the class for ops.

Functions:
---------
9) Keep functions small
10) blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should be one line long. 
11)functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures. Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two. 
12) Do one thing
