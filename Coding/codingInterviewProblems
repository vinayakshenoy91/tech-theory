1) Shorted range in K sorted list
- Make K lists and keep a list pointer for each
- Make 6 placeholders => min, max and range for a particular iteration. minRangeMin, minRangeMax and minRange at a global level.
Only if range for iteration is < minRange, update the global parameters with the respective iteration parameters
- Whichever is minimum keep moving that pointer forward
- Stopping condition is if any iteration goes out of the list.

- The time complexity has : iterating through min list (which is n times) and then finding min and max in each iteration
Total time complexity: O(n*k)
Space complexity: O(1)

More effecient: Using minHeap -> O(n*log(k))
