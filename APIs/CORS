For request methods other than: GET, HEAD, and POST; CORS defines a preflight request interaction. The preflight request occurs “behind-the-scenes” between a CORS-compliant browser and server, in advance of the JavaScript client’s actual request to access a cross-origin resource. REST APIs may use the CORS-proposed Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header to list the set of origins that are permitted cross-origin access to its resources. Most modern browsers support CORS by sending special HTTP request headers such as Origin and Access-Control-Request-Method. The Origin header value identifies the requesting JavaScript client’s scheme/host/port source location. The Access-Control-Request-Method header value is sent in the CORS preflight request to indicate which HTTP method will be used in the client’s actual request.
