However, doing so in an uncontrolled manner can, and will most likely, result in what some call a hyperconnectivity mess. 

This is when IT systems are interconnected and dependent on APIs, but no one within the enterprise really has visibility 
and/or understanding of this. Not only can this result in a serious gap in accountability when issues occur, but, in an 
even more complex IT landscape, systems can have real exposure to issues outside of the control of enterprise IT.


A hyperconnectivity mess occurs as a result of APIs being used in an ad hoc manner and without proper governance. At this point, 
the business benefits that APIs have to offer 
can be countered by the risks they can introduce to core enterprise systems, and thus business operations themselves.
