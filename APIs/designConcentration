API-led architecture should address things like:

Securing APIs from unauthorized access and major security threats.
Ensuring that consuming applications can always find the right API endpoint.
Throttling and/or limiting the number of calls made to an API to ensure continuous availability.
Supporting capabilities such as API design, testing, continuous integration, life cycle management, monitoring, and operations, to name a few.
Error handling and preventing error propagation across the stack.
Real-time monitoring of APIs with rich analytics and insight.
An approach for implementing scalable and flexible business capabilities, for example, in support of microservices architectures.
