- It is an algo paradigm that builds the solution piece by piece
- It fits well for those soln in which local optimnal soln lead to global soln
- It constructs the final solution by choosing the best option possible in every iteration.
It combines locally optimal solutions to get the global solution.

Greedy algos:
--------------
- Dijkstra
- Insertion sort
- Topological sort
- Prim's
- Kruskal
