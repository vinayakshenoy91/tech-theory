- It is a form of recursion
- General algo to find all soln to some computational problems
- These are called constraint satisfaction problems
- Important while solving combinatorial optimisation problems like TSP,etc
- Ex used in N-queens/sudoku
- We can discard several bad states with one iteration. ---> VVIP
- Most of these problems can be represented with a tree structure. It is called game tree or potential search tree.
- If partial candidate A cannot be completed to a valid solution then we abandon A as a solution.
- It is same as DFS
- The algo backtracks to previous state if the actual one is not feasible.
