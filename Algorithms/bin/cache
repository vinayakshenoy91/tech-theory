- Hashtable + Doubly Linked List
- Splay trees work fine but again we store all items in a tree like structure.
- We just update references which can be done in O(1) constant time complexity
- Use age bits to track items in cache. Higher age bits means frequently used.
- When cache full, remove least recently used.
