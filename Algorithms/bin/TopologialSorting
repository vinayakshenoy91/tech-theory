- Topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that
for every directed edge uv from vertex u to v , u comes before v in the ordering

- Vertices represent task and edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another

- Topological ordering is just a valid sequence of task

- We can use topological ordering only if the graph has no directed cycles.(DAG)

- Any DAG has atleast one topological order

- Has linear time complexity

- Hamiltonian path: It is a path in an undirected  or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once.

- If hamiltonian path exists, the topological sort order is unique, no other order respects the edges of the path.
 Conversly, if a topological sort does not form a Hamiltonian path, the DAG will have two or more valid topological orderings.
 
 - Finding hamiltonian path is NP complete problem, but we can decide whether such a path exist in linear time.
 
 
- In topological sorting, we need to find a vertex with no incoming edges + keep repeating it over and over again.
Going to tell us what order we need to do things.
