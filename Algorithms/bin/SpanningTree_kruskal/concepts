G=(V,E)
V= {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5}
E={(v1,v2),(v1,v3),(v2,v4),(v3,v4)}

- Directed graph
indegree  //Number of edges coming to it
outdegree //Number of edges going out of it

Sum of indegree= |E| ==> number of edges
Sum of outdegree= |E| ==> number of edges

Max number of edges = |v|*(|v|-1)

- Undirected graph: 
 degree = number of edges conneted to it
 sum of degree =2 * |E|
 Max number of edges = |v|*(|v|-1)/2
 
 - Walk(Sometimes path): v1,v2,v4,v2
 - Path(Sometimes simple path: v1,v2,v4 | no repetition of vertices allowed
 - Cyclic: There exists a walk that begins and ends with same vertex.
 - Acyclic graph: Donot containa cycle.
 - DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph (Huge advantages)
 - Weighted graph: Weights assigned to edges.
 
 
 Graph representations:
 -----------------------
 1) Adjacency list
 
 
 
 
 2) Adjacency matrix 
 - Size of matrix v x v
 - mat[i][j]={1 if there is an edge, 0 otherwise}
 - For undirected graph its always a symmetric matrix
