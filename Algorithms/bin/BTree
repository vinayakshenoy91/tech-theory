- Trees are stored in RAM
- Stack and heap are in RAM
- Accessing block (512bytes which is part of track) is slow. We should minimize amount of read operations.
- Recursion woks well in RAM not in external memory(HDD)
- So BTree which are shallow structures are used.
- BTree are self balancing tree like DS . All ops in O(logN)
- Nodes may have more than 2 children + multiple keys
- Optimized for system that read and write large block of data.
- Use in BD and FS



Properties:
-----------
- All the nodes of the tree structure can contain m keys - so it may have m+1 children (branching factor)
- every node is atleast half full - So atleast m/2 items
- if the N number of items in a node is less than m/2 then we merge it with another node and if N>m, then we split the node.
- All leaf nodes are at the same level (balanced)
