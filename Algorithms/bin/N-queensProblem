- N chess queens on NxN chessboard so no two queens threaten each other.
- O(NxN) states that is O(N!) running time with brute force.
- We can use backtracking and eliminate bad states but still result will be O(2^N)
- If position of queen is not right, then you backtrack to that queen and then move the next queen.
We have to step back to the previous column and increment the position of the queen there.
You sometimes may have to backtrack to first position.
