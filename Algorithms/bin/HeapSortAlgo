Heaps-sort:
-----------
- We know root has largest value
- Swap root with last element in array
- Heapify the tree but exclude the last node.
- After heapify, second largest element is at the root.
- Rinse and repeat


Fractional Knapsack problem:
---------------------------
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection
so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
