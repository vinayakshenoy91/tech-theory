- Disjoint sets are union-find data structure.
- It is to keep track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non overlapping) subsets.
- Three main ops, union, find and make sets.
- Disjoint sets are impl as tree like structure.

- In kruskal algo, it will be useful to see if we can decide in approx O(1) time whether two vertexes are in same set or not.
- We can find cycles in graph with this DS in O(logN)
