- find cycles in directed G(V,E) graph.
- We want to find cycles when we try to detect arbitrage opportunities on the FOREX
- arbitrage trading involves the buying and selling of different currency pairs to exploit any
pricing ineffeciencies.

- To avoid cycles, OS uses resource allocation graph (RAG) to avoid any cycles.

- Backward edges always indicates cycles.
- Backwards edge (u,v) edge points from a node u to one of its v ancestors.
- O(v+e) -> Time complexity with DFS
