- Graphs are made up of nodes (vertices) and connected by edges (Links)

1) Undirected graph:
--------------------
- Set of vertices and edges where edges are bidirectional
- (u,v) identical to (v,u)


2) Directed graph:
--------------------
- Edges have direction


3) Trees: 
---------
It is an undirected graph where two vertices are connected by exactly one path

4) Forest: 
---------
It is an undirected graph, all of whose components are trees
(disjoint union of trees)

5) Directed Acyclic Graph: 
---------------------------
It is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles

6) Complete graphs:
--------------------
- In complete graphs, every single pair of vertices(nodes) are connected.
