- If N items in a balanced tree, then there will be N/2 leaf nodes

- Time complexity is : O(V+E)
- Memory complexity is bit better than BFS
- DFS you use Stack and BFS you use Queue.
- Use DFS if you require less memory

Difference between DFS and BFS:
-------------------------------
- In BFS we store, N items. IN DFS, memory complexity O(logN) which is the height of tree.
