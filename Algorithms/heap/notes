- Special type of binary tree.
- A complete binray tree.
- Max heap: Every parent is greater than children
- Min heap: Every parent is less than or equal to its children.
- Min and max value will always be in the root -> USP of heap
- Heapify -> Process to convert binary tree into heap.


- Read priority queue docs

- UsePriorityBlockingQueue for sync as priority queue is not sync.
- Priority queue stores minimum at the top


- You can pass a comparator. As long as it has comparable interface, pq will work.
